# Graph Processing Platforms

The efficient processing of large graphs is challenging. As graphs increase in variety and volume, analysts need to resort to high performance computing (HPC) methodologies so they can develop solutions deployable on parallel and distributed architectures. However, the already well established HPC methods are ill-suited for graph processing since graph applications differs from usual HPC applications. The former are data intensive while the latter are compute intensive. More specifically, graph analytic tasks suffer from inherent difficulties such as data driven computation, high data-access computing ratio, and poor locality of memory access. Furthermore, as one's analysis requires a more complex infrastructure such as a distributed one, the substantial development effort for crafting each new analysis solution turns imperative the adoption of software platforms --- DBMS, frameworks and libraries --- to alleviate the development burden. For this reason, many platforms data oriented and graph specific have been proposed; we estimate that there are currently more than 180 platforms that can be employed in graph analytic tasks.

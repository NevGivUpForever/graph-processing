  description: "Maverick is an extensible framework for discovering exceptional facts\
    \ about entities in knowledge graphs. An exceptional fact separates an entity\
    \ from another entity. In each exceptional fact, among all entities in the context,\
    \ the entity of interest is one of the few or even the one that bear the particular\
    \ value combination on the qualifying attributes. Discovery of exceptional facts\
    \ is useful to application such as computational journalism, recommendation systems\
    \ and data cleaning. Given an entity in a knowledge graph, an integer k, and a\
    \ expceptionality scoring function, the objective of exceptional fact discovery\
    \ is to find the top-k highest scored pairs of (context, attribute set). In this\
    \ context, the attributes of an entity are the entity's incoming/outgoing edge\
    \ labels, and the attribute values are the entity's direct neighbors. A context\
    \ is a set of entities sharing some common characteristics defined in a pattern\
    \ query. An entity is exceptional in a context if its attribute values deviate\
    \ from the values of other entities in the same context.\n"
